## About
---
Probably **overcomplicated**   
Certainly   **not finished**    
Definitively  **heretical** ;p  

I was aware of vim/nvim for years, after switching to linux I figured It was  
finally time to try it out.  
At first I hesitated between nvim and emacs, but lua and the motions intrigued me...  
I am still in the "hjkl? hu no? arrow's fine" phase though, haha.  

My text editor journey:  
`Code::Blocks → Notepad++ → Visual Studio → VSCode → Neovim`



## ✨ Features
---
### ✏️Editing
---
- Hundreds of custom keymaps (I am unable to stop myself ;p)  
- Extensive mouse support! (°)°) with mouse binds! 
- Native Word "speed dial" in normal mode with `+` / `-`  
- with Easy toggling of booleans: `true/false`, `yes/no`, `on/off`  
- and Capitalization flipping  
- Auto-pairing via **nvim-autopairs**  
- Built-in white spaces trimming on save (+custom command)  
- Completion via **blink.cmp**, with extensive config including cmdline 
  completion
- Built-in auto save with a timer every 7min

### 📂 File Management

### 📦 Plugin Management
---
- Managed via **lazy.nvim**


## 🚀 Installation
---
Install the latest version of neovim with your package manager of choice.  
Backup existing config files if applicable.  
```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_bak
```    
Go to config files location
```sh
cd ~/.config/nvim/
```
Clone the repo:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/qiine/qiine-nvim-conf.git
```
Open Neovim.  
```sh
nvim  
```
Plugins will install automatically thanks to lazy.nvim  


### 🧪 Requirements
* Terminal  
  I choosed wezterm, 
  config: [github.com/qiine/wezterm-conf](https://github.com/qiine/wezterm-conf)

  As neovim is a terminal centered application and I use a very complex sets 
  of keybinds, a terminal supporting kitty keyboard reporting protocol or 
  similar is a must.

  I have not spent any time making my nvim config usable 
  with other terminals and don't plan to. (I know Konsol struggles)

* git
* ripgrep
* fd
* fzf

optional
- stylua
- marksman
- lua_ls
- luacheck
- eslint_d
